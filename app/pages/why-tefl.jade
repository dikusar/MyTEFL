						.title-st-2.mb-20.uppercase It Opens the World For You
						p.mb-25 With the lacklustre economy and lack of jobs for new college graduates, now is the opportunity of a lifetime to go overseas, broaden your horizons, learn a new language, live in exotic places, and earn money at the same time! Teaching English to Foreign Learners is a well-rounded experience that will intrigue future employers, shape your character abilities, diversify your resume, and give you a better perspective on the world. But before you take off, it's a good idea to be prepared for that first day you walk in a classroom full of eager and nervous learners. Few TEFLers are provided with the tools and training to minimize the anxiety and doubt that haunt new teachers...until NOW!
