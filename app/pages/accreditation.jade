						p MyTEFL.net and its parent company, Footprints Language Education Ltd. (FLE) are institutional members of the International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (IATEFL), the largest and most comprehensive TEFL organization in the world. Our courses are recognized and moderated by the Online TESOL and TEFL Standards Agency (OTTSA), an independent third party standards board that is dedicated to increasing teacher training standards. Our TEFL courses have been carefully developed, rigorously tested and peer reviewed to ensure we not only meet, but exceed internationally set standards.

						p.mb-25 In addition to external validation, we have over 40 years of combined experience teaching, writing, publishing, managing, and consulting in EFL markets worldwide. As part of our internal Research & Development System, we field test our TEFL courses within our own Language Training School branches in Asia. An inexperienced teacher completes one of our TEFL courses and starts teaching English in our classrooms. We monitor and evaluate their performance on multiple metrics, including multi-party feedback, classroom strategy, lesson development, and student results. We gather and interpret the information to further hone and improve on our courses.
